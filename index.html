             <li> I love being part of a process that allows me to witness initial ideas being drawn on the back of a napkin and transform those ideas into robust, creative and responsive web applications for the world to see.  I am currently a property manager for an apartment community that my company recently acquired and through that process I fell in love with my passion of web developing by meeting a group of students in our lounge who were all studying to be web developers. Ever since I met them, I was intrigued, hooked and now I am here creating my portfolio and displaying it to company’s whom I will hopefully be part of sometime very soon. 
            When I am not writing code, you can find me training at the gym for an upcoming Body building competition or spending quality time with my family making lasting memories. </li>
